# Claude Companion for Obsidian

Bring Claude *into* your vault. Chat with your notes as context, generate
gallery-grade interactive artifacts, and sync everything Claude produces back
into Markdown — so your vault stays the single source of truth.

The artifact design system is lifted directly from Anthropic's
[“unreasonable effectiveness of HTML”](../README.md) gallery that lives in this
repo, so the plans, reports, and dashboards Claude generates look like they
belong next to it.

> **Bring your own key.** Claude Companion talks to the Anthropic Messages API
> with *your* API key. Nothing is sent anywhere else. Desktop only (it needs
> direct network access).
>
> **Why not “log in with Claude.ai”?** As of 2026 Anthropic prohibits using
> Free/Pro/Max OAuth tokens in third-party tools (the policy behind the OpenClaw
> ban). Using them would risk your account and disqualify the plugin from the
> community store, so Companion uses a standard API key. For a *unified* setup
> with your Claude Code / claude.ai work, the intended path is a **Claude Code
> / MCP bridge** (on the roadmap) rather than subscription OAuth.

## Features

- **Chat in a side panel** — streaming responses, Markdown-rendered, with
  per-message **Copy / Insert / Save as note** actions.
- **Vault-aware context** — toggle chips to attach your **active note**, the
  **current selection**, **linked & backlinked notes**, or a keyword
  **vault search** (lightweight RAG, no embeddings) to any message.
- **Beautiful interactive artifacts** — Claude emits a `claude-html` block;
  Companion renders it inline in a sandboxed iframe and can **save it as a
  note** that stays interactive and portable.
- **Local models (Ollama)** — route cheap, bulk work (summaries, auto-tagging,
  ingestion) to a local model so Anthropic tokens are reserved for high-level
  reasoning. Chat and plans can run locally too if you prefer. Settings can
  **auto-detect** the models installed on your Ollama server.
- **Live usage display** — the chat shows a context-window gauge (how full the
  prompt is getting) plus running **session token totals and an estimated cost**
  when using an API key, so there are no billing surprises.
- **Indexing & tags** — saved artifacts and chats get YAML frontmatter
  (`title`, `tags`, `summary`, `type`) so they show up correctly in the tag
  pane, search, and Dataview. Optional **auto-tagging** uses the local model to
  suggest topic tags, reusing your existing vault tags where they fit.
- **Save & test connection** — one click confirms settings are saved and the
  key actually works, with readable, actionable errors.
- **Commands**
  - *Open chat panel*
  - *Generate implementation plan from current note*
  - *Turn selection / note into a beautiful artifact*
  - *Ask Claude about my vault (search-augmented)*

## Install (manual / for now)

1. `cd obsidian-plugin && npm install && npm run build`
2. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into
   `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/claude-companion/`.
3. Enable **Claude Companion** in *Settings → Community plugins*.
4. Open *Settings → Claude Companion* and paste your Anthropic API key.

For active development use `npm run dev` (esbuild watch) and symlink the plugin
folder into a test vault.

## Development & testing

The Obsidian-free logic (SSE parsing, artifact extraction, search scoring) is
factored into pure modules so it can be unit-tested without a running app.

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint
npm test            # vitest (unit tests in test/)
npm run build       # typecheck + production bundle
```

CI runs all four on every push/PR (Node 20 & 22) via
[`.github/workflows/obsidian-plugin-ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/obsidian-plugin-ci.yml).

### Manual test checklist (needs a real vault + API key)

- [ ] Settings: API key saves; model dropdown + custom id both take effect.
- [ ] Chat streams; **Stop** aborts mid-stream; **New chat** clears history.
- [ ] Context chips: active note / selection / links / vault-search each attach
      (the `+ context:` line under your message reflects what was sent).
- [ ] "Generate implementation plan from current note" yields a `claude-html`
      artifact that renders inline.
- [ ] **Save artifact** writes a note that re-renders in Reading view; **Open ↗**
      opens it in a new window.
- [ ] Invalid key surfaces a friendly error instead of failing silently.

## Unified bridge (MCP server)

Companion can expose your vault as a local **MCP server**, so **Claude Code** and
**Claude Desktop** work against the *same* knowledge base you chat with here —
the compliant way to unify all three without subscription OAuth.

Enable it in *Settings → Claude Companion → Unified bridge (MCP server)*. It:

- binds to **127.0.0.1 only** (never the network) and requires a **bearer token**;
- exposes read tools always (`vault_search`, `note_read`, `list_recent`,
  `vault_tags`) and, when *Allow writes* is on, `note_create` / `note_append`;
- shows ready-to-paste connection snippets for both clients.

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http obsidian-vault \
  http://127.0.0.1:22360/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`, via `mcp-remote`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-vault": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:22360/mcp",
               "--header", "Authorization: Bearer <token>"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now ask Claude Code "search my vault for X" or "create a note summarizing this"
and it operates directly on your Obsidian notes.

## How artifacts work

When Claude returns a fenced ```` ```claude-html ```` block, Companion renders
the document inside a **sandboxed** iframe (`allow-scripts` but **not**
`allow-same-origin`) — interactions and scripts run, but the artifact can't
touch your vault, cookies, or the network. Set a height per-block with
` ```claude-html height=720 `.

Saving an artifact writes a Markdown note containing that same block, so the
artifact lives in your vault, renders in Reading view, and travels with your
notes.

## The `claude-html` block

You can author these by hand too:

````markdown
```claude-html height=600
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>Hello</title></head>
<body style="font-family:ui-serif;background:#FAF9F5;padding:40px">
  <h1 style="color:#141413">It renders inline.</h1>
</body></html>
```
````

## Releasing to the community store (notes)

This plugin currently lives inside the `html-effectiveness` repo for
convenience. To submit to Obsidian's community catalog it should be extracted
into its own repository (the build output `main.js` + `manifest.json` +
`styles.css` attached to a GitHub release). Also review the plugin **name** —
Obsidian's guidelines ask you to avoid trademarks you don't own, so a release
name like *“Companion for Claude”* may be more appropriate.
